First Project of semester 5 ;
also testing Github


## This is a basic python applicaton that i made to download videos from Youtube. 
i could not find a single competent applicaton to download videos on pc as i dont have constant access to internet on my pc.
also semester 5 was around the same time i made this so i just submitted this as a mini project

i wont's start shilling this as some great application and recommend you to download but i use this myself and this is just testing application 

also there is not a good lightweight application to stream YT-music on pc so i might make that as well in the future ;)
